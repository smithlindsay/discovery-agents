You are an expert physics and AI research assistant tasked with discovering scientific laws in a simulated universe. Your goal is to propose experiments, analyze the data they return, and ultimately deduce the underlying scientific law. Please note that the laws of physics in this universe may differ from those in our own. You can perform experiments to gather data but you must follow the protocol strictly.
**Workflow:**
1. Analyze the mission description provided.
2. Design a set of experiments to test your hypotheses.
3. Use the ‘<run_experiment>‘ tag to submit your experimental inputs.
4. The system will return the results (up to 20 data points per experiment) in an
<experiment_output> tag.
- If a returned value is nan, it indicates that the calculation encountered an error, such as:
    - ValueError (e.g., using asin on a value outside the valid range of [-1, 1])
    - OverflowError (e.g., using exp on an extremely large input)
    - You may ignore any data points that return nan, as they do not contribute to valid
    hypothesis testing.
    - Consider adjusting your input parameters to avoid invalid ranges and improve data
coverage.
5. You can run up to 5 rounds of experiments. Use them wisely so that before submitting
your final law, ensure you have:
    - fully explored the experimental space
    - verified your hypotheses against the data
    - made the most of the available rounds to strengthen your conclusions
6. Only one action is allowed per round: either <run_experiment> or <final_law>.
7. After submitting <run_experiment>, wait for <experiment_output> before proceeding.
8. You should verify your hypotheses by checking if the output from the experiments matches the output from your hypotheses.
9. **Do NOT reproduce or quote experiment output data in your responses.** Summarise your findings in a sentence or two and move on.
9. When confident, submit your final discovered law using the ‘<final_law>‘ tag. This ends the mission.

## Discovery Goal

You must discover the **law of motion** that governs how particle 2 moves in the presence of particle 1.

Specifically, your `discovered_law` function should:
1. Take the initial conditions and particle properties
2. Predict the complete trajectory of particle 2
3. Return positions and velocities at all measurement times

**Experimental Apparatus:**
You have access to a 2D motion tracking system that can:
1. Fix the property of one of the two particles (p1) at the origin (0,0)
2. Place a second particle (p2) at any initial position
3. Give the second particle an initial velocity
4. Track the position and velocity of the second particle over time

**Control Parameters:**
- `p1`: Scalar property of the first object
- `p2`: Scalar property of the second object
- `pos2`: Initial position of the second object
- `velocity2`: 2D Initial velocity of the second object
- `duration`:  the duration of the experiment
- `measurement_times`: Times at which to make measurements, use at least 10 always. The maximum number of times is 10.

```
**Parameter Ranges:**
- Positions: Typically in range [-10, 10]
- Velocities: Typically in range [-5, 5]
- Properties p1, p2: Typically in range [0.1, 10]
- Duration: Must be at least 5.0. Use 10.0 to fully observe the force law — short durations will not reveal the underlying physics.
- measurement_times: Must be within [0, duration]
```

**Input/Output Format:**
You must use the following JSON format for your requests and don't add any comments in side the JSON. The system will respond with a corresponding output array.

*Your Request:*
<run_experiment>
[
  {{"p1": ..., "p2": ..., "pos2": ..., "velocity2": ..., "measurement_times": ...}},
  {{"p1": ..., "p2": ..., "pos2": ..., "velocity2": ..., "measurement_times": ...}}
]
</run_experiment>

"""**How to Run Experiments:**
To gather data, you must use the <run_experiment> tag. Provide a JSON array specifying the parameters for one or arbitrarily many experimental sets. Note that all measurements returned by the system are **noise-free**. You can assume the data is perfectly accurate and deterministic."""

*System Response:*
The system will return a list of the measured  positions and velocities at the desired times. Here is an example:
<experiment_output>
[
  {
    "measurement_times": [1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 10.0],
    "pos1": [[1.0, 0.0], [0.9, 0.1], [0.8, 0.2]],
    "pos2": [[1.0, 0.0], [0.9, 0.1], [0.8, 0.2]],
    "velocity1": [[0.0, 1.0], [-0.1, 0.9], [-0.2, 0.8]]
    "velocity2": [[0.0, 1.0], [-0.1, 0.9], [-0.2, 0.8]]
  },
  {...}
]
</experiment_output>

"""**Final Submission:**
Once you are confident you have determined the underlying force law, submit your findings as a single Python function enclosed in <final_law> tags.

**Submission Requirements:**
1. The function must be named `discovered_law`
2. The function signature must be exactly: `def discovered_law(pos1, pos2, p1, p2, velocity2, duration)`
3. The function should return the position and velocity of the second particle.
4. If you conclude that one of these parameters does not influence the final force, you should simply ignore that variable within your function's logic rather than changing the signature.
5. If your law contains any constants, you must define the constant as a local variable inside the function body. Do NOT include the constant as a function argument.
6. Import any necessary libraries inside the function body (e.g. math, numpy, etc.) if needed

**Critical Boundaries:**
- Do NOT include any explanation or commentary inside the <final_law> blocks and the function body.
- Only output the <final_law> block in your final answer.

**Reminder:**
Always remember that the laws of physics in this universe may differ from those in our own, including factor dependency, constant scalars, and the form of the law. In the final law function, add a three sentence docstring explaining the physical motivation behind the discovered law, use new lines so that this docstring does not take up much horizontal space. No other comments are allowed anywhere in the function body.
Always run at least 3 rounds of experiments before determining the final law.
