You are an expert physics and AI research assistant tasked with discovering scientific laws in a simulated universe. Your goal is to propose experiments, analyze the data they return, and ultimately deduce the underlying law of motion. Please note that the laws of physics in this universe may differ from those in our own.

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze the mission description provided.
2. Design experiments to test your hypotheses.
3. Use the `<run_experiment>` tag to submit your experimental inputs.
4. The system will return results in an `<experiment_output>` tag.
5. You can run up to 10 rounds of experiments. Use them wisely.
6. Only one action is allowed per round: either `<run_experiment>` or `<final_law>`.
7. After submitting `<run_experiment>`, wait for `<experiment_output>` before proceeding.
8. Verify your hypotheses against the data before submitting.
9. When confident, submit your final law using the `<final_law>` tag.
10. **Do NOT reproduce or quote experiment output data in your responses.** Summarise your findings in a sentence or two and move on.

## Discovery Goal

You must discover the **law of motion** governing all 11 particles in this system.

Your `discovered_law` function must:
1. Take the initial conditions of all 11 particles
2. Simulate their motion forward in time
3. Return their positions at time `t = duration`

## Experimental Apparatus

You observe a system of **11 particles** in a 2D universe:
- **Particle 0**: starts at the center `[0, 0]`
- **Particles 1–10**: arranged equally spaced on a ring of radius `ring_radius`

All particles interact through an unknown field. You can control:
- `ring_radius`: initial distance from center to ring particles (typical range: 2–10)
- `initial_tangential_velocity`: initial CCW tangential speed for ring particles (typical range: 0–2)
- `measurement_times`: times at which to record positions and velocities (up to 10 values, within `[0, duration]`)

**Important:** Use `duration ≥ 10.0` and at least 10 measurement times to observe the force law clearly.

**Input Format:**
<run_experiment>
[
  {"ring_radius": 5.0, "initial_tangential_velocity": 0.0, "measurement_times": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]},
  {"ring_radius": 3.0, "initial_tangential_velocity": 0.0, "measurement_times": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]}
]
</run_experiment>

**Output Format:**
<experiment_output>
[
  {
    "measurement_times": [1.0, 2.0, ...],
    "positions":  [[[x0,y0],[x1,y1],...,[x10,y10]], ...],  // shape (T, 11, 2), relative to center
    "velocities": [[[vx0,vy0],[vx1,vy1],...], ...]          // shape (T, 11, 2)
  },
  {...}
]
</experiment_output>

Positions are given relative to the domain center (particle 0 starts at [0,0]).
Particle ordering is fixed: index 0 = center, indices 1–10 = ring particles in CCW order.
Reported particle positions may contain **Gaussian observation noise of unknown scale**. Reported velocities are clean. Design your experiments and fit your law accordingly (e.g. by using longer durations or repeated measurements to average over noise).

## Strategy

- Start by varying `ring_radius` to probe force-distance scaling. How fast do ring particles fall inward as a function of radius?
- Try non-zero `initial_tangential_velocity` to see if particles orbit or spiral.
- Pay attention to the **center particle**: does it move symmetrically, or stay put?
- The force law may not be the standard Laplacian (1/r in 2D). Look for anomalous power-law scaling.
- To identify the exponent, measure infall speed or displacement at different radii and fit a power law.

## Final Submission

Once confident, submit a single Python function in `<final_law>` tags.

**Requirements:**
1. Function name: `discovered_law`
2. Signature: `def discovered_law(positions, velocities, duration, **params)` — the `**params` catch-all lets the evaluator inject fitted values. Omit `**params` only if you have no fittable parameters.
   - `positions`: list of 11 `[x, y]` coords relative to center at `t=0`
   - `velocities`: list of 11 `[vx, vy]` at `t=0`
   - `duration`: float, time to simulate
3. Return: a list or array of 11 `[x, y]` final positions at `t=duration`
4. Constants you are CERTAIN about should be hard-coded inside the function body. Constants that remain UNCERTAIN (exponents, couplings) should be declared as *fittable parameters* via the optional `fit_parameters()` function below.
5. Import any required libraries inside the function body.

**Fittable Parameters (optional, recommended when you have uncertain constants):**
Alongside `discovered_law`, you may define a second function `fit_parameters()` that returns a dict of free parameters the evaluator should fit with `scipy.optimize` on the training trajectories you already collected. Each entry must provide a sensible starting value (`init`) and physically plausible bounds (`bounds`). At most **5** free parameters are allowed.

```
def fit_parameters():
    return {
        "alpha": {"init": 0.75, "bounds": [0.2, 1.5]},
        "G":     {"init": 1.0,  "bounds": [0.01, 10.0]},
    }
```

Inside `discovered_law`, read fitted values from `**params` (e.g. `alpha = params.get("alpha", 0.75)`), defaulting to your best guess so the law still works if fitting is skipped. You are scored on whether you got the *functional form* right, not on pinning the constants by hand.

**Submission format:**
<final_law>
def discovered_law(positions, velocities, duration, **params):
    """
    Three-sentence docstring explaining the discovered physics.
    Include the key force law and any important constants.
    No other comments are allowed anywhere in the function body.
    """
    import numpy as np
    alpha = params.get("alpha", 0.75)
    # your implementation
    return final_positions

def fit_parameters():
    return {"alpha": {"init": 0.75, "bounds": [0.2, 1.5]}}
</final_law>

**Critical:**
- Do NOT include explanation or commentary outside the function body inside the `<final_law>` block.
- In your final-submission round, output ONLY the `<final_law>` block followed by a single `<explanation>` block (described below). No other prose.
- Always run at least 3 rounds of experiments before submitting.

**Explanation Tag (required in the final submission round):**
Alongside your `<final_law>`, you MUST also include a separate `<explanation>` tag containing a 2–3 sentence prose description of the physical system you discovered. Describe the underlying field equation, how particles couple to it, and any structural features you identified — in plain English, not code. This is graded independently from the trajectory accuracy.

Example final-round response:
<final_law>
def discovered_law(positions, velocities, duration):
    ...
</final_law>
<explanation>
The 11 particles interact through a static field governed by a non-local fractional Laplacian operator. The force on each particle is minus the gradient of the field, which is sourced by all particles with uniform coupling. The force-versus-distance law is intermediate between logarithmic 2D gravity and pure long-range behavior.
</explanation>
