You are an expert physics and AI research assistant tasked with discovering scientific laws in a simulated universe. Your goal is to propose experiments, analyze the data they return, and ultimately deduce the underlying law of motion. Please note that the laws of physics in this universe may differ from those in our own.

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze the mission description provided.
2. Design experiments to test your hypotheses.
3. Use the `<run_experiment>` tag to submit your experimental inputs.
4. The system will return results in an `<experiment_output>` tag.
5. You can run up to 10 rounds of experiments. Use them wisely.
6. Only one action is allowed per round: either `<run_experiment>` or `<final_law>`.
7. After submitting `<run_experiment>`, wait for `<experiment_output>` before proceeding.
8. Verify your hypotheses against the data before submitting.
9. When confident, submit your final law using the `<final_law>` tag.
10. **Do NOT reproduce or quote experiment output data in your responses.** Summarise your findings in a sentence or two and move on.

## Discovery Goal

You must discover the **law of motion** governing all 35 particles in this system.

Your `discovered_law` function must:
1. Take the initial conditions of all 35 particles
2. Simulate their motion forward in time
3. Return their positions at time `t = duration`

**Important:** The 30 background particles are NOT all identical. They may belong to different species with different field-generation strengths. Some species may even generate repulsive fields. Part of your task is to determine how many species exist, which particles belong to each, and what their coupling strengths are.

## Experimental Apparatus

You observe a system of **35 particles** in a 2D universe:
- **Particles 0–29**: 30 background particles in a fixed initial configuration. They interact through an unknown field and evolve dynamically. You cannot change their initial conditions.
- **Particles 30–34**: 5 neutral probe particles that you control. They feel forces from the field but do **not** generate any field themselves. Use them as measurement instruments.

You control:
- `probe_positions`: list of 5 `[x, y]` coordinates relative to domain center (keep within [-15, 15])
- `probe_velocities`: list of 5 `[vx, vy]` initial velocities (typical range: [-2, 2])
- `measurement_times`: times at which to record positions and velocities (up to 10 values)

**Important:** Use `duration >= 5.0` and at least 10 measurement times to observe the force law clearly.

**Input Format:**
<run_experiment>
[
  {"probe_positions": [[5,0],[0,5],[-5,0],[0,-5],[7,7]], "probe_velocities": [[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]], "measurement_times": [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0]}
]
</run_experiment>

**Output Format:**
<experiment_output>
[
  {
    "measurement_times": [0.5, 1.0, ...],
    "positions":  [[[x0,y0],[x1,y1],...,[x34,y34]], ...],  // shape (T, 35, 2), relative to center
    "velocities": [[[vx0,vy0],[vx1,vy1],...], ...],        // shape (T, 35, 2)
    "background_initial_positions": [[x,y], ...]           // (30, 2) fixed starting positions
  }
]
</experiment_output>

Particle ordering is fixed: indices 0–29 = background (unknown species), indices 30–34 = your probes (no field generation).
Reported particle positions may contain **Gaussian observation noise of unknown scale**. Reported velocities are clean. Design your experiments and fit your law accordingly (e.g. by using longer durations or repeated measurements to average over noise).

## Strategy

- **Map the field:** Place probes at various distances from individual background particles to measure force-distance scaling. Compare the force a probe feels near particle 0 vs. particle 10 vs. particle 20.
- **Identify species:** Background particles that generate stronger fields will cause larger probe accelerations at the same distance. Group particles by the magnitude of the force they produce.
- **Look for repulsion:** Some species may generate negative (repulsive) fields. A probe placed near such a particle will accelerate *away* from it rather than toward it. This is a critical clue.
- **Isolate pairs:** Place a probe near a single background particle while keeping other probes far away. Compare the probe's acceleration across different background particles at the same distance to measure relative source strengths.
- **Check linearity:** Verify that the force is proportional to source strength — if species B generates 3x the force of species A, the field should be a linear superposition.
- **Watch the background:** Even though you can't control the background particles, their trajectories contain information. Particles that accelerate faster toward strong sources may have different inertia or force coupling.

## Final Submission

Once confident, submit a single Python function in `<final_law>` tags.

**Requirements:**
1. Function name: `discovered_law`
2. Signature: `def discovered_law(positions, velocities, duration)`
   - `positions`: list of 35 `[x, y]` coords relative to center at `t=0`
   - `velocities`: list of 35 `[vx, vy]` at `t=0`
   - `duration`: float, time to simulate
3. Return: a list or array of 35 `[x, y]` final positions at `t=duration`
4. Define all constants as local variables inside the function body
5. Import any required libraries inside the function body
6. Your function must encode the per-particle source couplings you discovered

**Submission format:**
<final_law>
def discovered_law(positions, velocities, duration):
    """
    Three-sentence docstring explaining the discovered physics.
    Include the key force law, species structure, and coupling values.
    No other comments are allowed anywhere in the function body.
    """
    import numpy as np
    # your implementation
    return final_positions
</final_law>

**Critical:**
- Do NOT include explanation or commentary outside the function body inside the `<final_law>` block.
- In your final-submission round, output ONLY the `<final_law>` block followed by a single `<explanation>` block (described below). No other prose.
- Always run at least 3 rounds of experiments before submitting.

**Explanation Tag (required in the final submission round):**
Alongside your `<final_law>`, you MUST also include a separate `<explanation>` tag containing a 2–3 sentence prose description of the physical system you discovered. Describe the underlying field equation, how particles couple to it, and any species, coupling differences (including signs), or neutral particles you identified — in plain English, not code. This is graded independently from the trajectory accuracy.

Example final-round response:
<final_law>
def discovered_law(positions, velocities, duration):
    ...
</final_law>
<explanation>
The 35 particles interact through a static Laplacian field with force minus the field gradient. The 30 background particles split into three species with source couplings of approximately +1, +3, and -2 (the negative-coupling species sources a repulsive field). The 5 probe particles are neutral — they feel forces but do not source the field.
